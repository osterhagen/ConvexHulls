Describe how you handle degenerate cases in the graham scan and gift-wrapping algorithm.




Describe the best and worst inputs to the Graham Scan algorithm




Compare the running times of the two algorithms on best, worst, and random inputs




Suppose the points are restricted to a d-by-d grid. What are the time and memory complexity of Graham Scan using radix sort? There is a version of Graham scan that sorts along the X axis. How does this change the complexity of the algorithm?
